A gallery of Core Plot examples for Mac OS X and iOS.

There are currently a few generic examples in the 
plots group of the Xcode projects, but the hope is 
to provide small simple examples that illustrate
a simple task in core-plot (creating a floating 
axis, for example).

To add a new plot:

1. Create a new class that derives from PlotItem

2. Add a 
	+ (void)load 
   class method to register the class via the
	[super registerPlotItem:self];
   message.
   This makes it show up in the tableview/imageview.

3. If you are only generating a single plot, override
   the renderInLayer:withTheme method to create your
   graphs.  Make sure you add your CPGraph object to
   the graphs array.

4. Add any delegate methods you need for handling
   labels or user interaction.

If your view consists of multiple plots, you also
need to override the 
	renderInView:withTheme 
method to set up your CPLayers. You should also 
override the 
	setFrameSize:  
on the Mac and 
	didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation:
on iOS to handle resizing and device rotation. See
the CompositePlot.[hm] files for an example of
creating multiple plots.

If you are just generating a single plot, the 
resizing and rotation handling are done for you.
